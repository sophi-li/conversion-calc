              Which weighs more, one pound of feathers or one pound of bricks?
            </p>
            <p>
              Great question, they're the same weight! <u>One pound</u> of
              feathers is equal to <u>one pound</u> of bricks, but the{' '}
              <i>volume</i> of <u>one pound</u> of feathers is{' '}
              <strong>greater</strong> than the <i>volume</i> of{' '}
              <u>one pound</u> of bricks.
            </p>
            <p className={styles.question}>
              Which weighs more, 100 grams of flour or 100 grams of honey?
            </p>
            <p>
              You know it, <u>100 grams</u> of flour and <u>100 grams</u> of
              honey are the same weight! But the <i>volume</i> of honey is{' '}
              <strong>greater</strong> than the <i>volume</i> of flour. 1 cup of
              honey is 336 grams while 1 cup of flour is 120 grams.
            </p>

            <p className={styles.question}>
              Is it better to measure by volume (ie. cups) or weight (ie.
              grams)?
            </p>
            <p>
              Because baking requires sharp precision, it's better to measure by
              weight. But we don't always have the right equipment to match a
              recipe. What if you have a recipe that specifies ingredients by
              weight, but you only have measuring cups? Or vice versa? Our{' '}
              <Link to={'/RecipeConversion'}>baking calculator</Link> has you
              covered. It'll help you convert your recipe from grams to cups or
              cups to grams.
            </p>

            <p className={styles.question}>What measurements do you support?</p>
            <p>Currently, we support grams, cups, tablespoons, teaspoons.</p>

              There's an ingredient missing, I don't think it's in your
              database. Can you add it?
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm working on adding more ingredients and conversions. Send me an{' '}
              <a href="mailto:sophiali124@gmail.com">email</a> and let me know
              what's missing.
            </p>

            <p className={styles.question}>
              How does the recipe calculator work?
            </p>
            <p>The recipe calculator:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Parses your recipe to determine what ingredients need to be
                converted
              </li>
              <li>Looks up the ingredient's conversion rate in our database</li>{' '}
              <li>
                Applies a formula to the ingredient's quantity based on the
                conversion rate
              </li>
              <li>Returns your original and converted recipe</li>
            </ol>

            <p className={styles.question}>Where can I find the source code?</p>
            <p>
